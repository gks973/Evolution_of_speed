# Evolution_of_speed
Code used for producing the figures shown in the article "Tradeoff between speed and reproductive number in pathogen evolution"

The MATLAB file "Exponential_growth_rate_measurement.m" was used to create Figs. 1 and 2

The Python file "ODE_sim.py" was used to create Fig. 4

The file seir_k.cpp contains C++ code for efficient simulations of the S(E_k)(I_k)R model at high k (i.e. SEIR simulations with I and E states subdivided into k stages each).
